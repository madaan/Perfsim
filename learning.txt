1. Experience counts will not give expected results until there is a 
skew in service rates. This is becuase in our case, with higher experience, 
a person will tend to go into a queue which is faster and smaller. 
Clearly, if all the servers have almost equal service rates, the notion of 
faster will not be there, and thus, an experienced user will not benefit at all.
The graph plotted from g1, g2 shows this.
